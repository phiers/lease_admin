## TO DO LIST

Issue in November: because Janie and Jack is not in customer file, their 111 open stores get added to the initial analysis file for J Crew. Need to figure out how to prevent this.


ADD LOGIC TO SPLIT OUT BONOBOS - THEY ARE STORES 05XXX THRU 05999
Another Nov issue: csv file added extra rows
Don't capture "not billed" on intial invoice analysis

5. Process #5 - file clean up
6. Add styling to final df
7. Remove "Not Billed" from final df (or remove from initial as part of review?) - do as part of review - add to instructions
8. Price vs LM - only show if price in both LM and TM price column final df
9. Final analysis LM prices are calculating in an odd way - just take total/quantity to calc?
